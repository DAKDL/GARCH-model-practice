## Overview

This project aims to practice GARCH modeling using data from B-TREASURY. GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, which is a statistical model used to estimate the volatility of financial markets.

### Project Steps

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data preprocessing:** The B-TREASURY data needs to be preprocessed to extract the relevant features and convert the data into a usable format.
2. **GARCH modeling:** The preprocessed data is used to fit a GARCH model, which estimates the volatility of the market.


## Installation
